It attempts to answer many of the questions students may have in the application process while serving as a reference for counselors in what can be an esoteric process. Written by <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/pub/luke-heine/95/419/54a>Luke Heine</a>, Harvard '17, MWC President and Playbook founder, this guide has been supported and peer reviewed by multiple members of the club. <i>Importantly, this information is not endorsed by the Harvard College Admissions Office or any other entity of Harvard; it's the sole opinion and property of its writer and reviewers.</i></p><p> A little bit on the writer, growing up in rural northern Minnesota, without the support of my community and more than a few serendipitous exchanges of information, I would not have the opportunity to affordably attend Harvard College, found the Playbook, or the myriad of experiences that have spurred from a rigorous education. My parents found it important for me to pay for my own secondary education--a blessing in disguise--making financial aid paramount, and so my senior year I applied to 21 of the world’s most prestigious post-secondary institutions in the hopes of using their financial aid packets to barter between schools. In the end, with a lot of work and more than a few strokes of luck, I succeeded, and I want you to, as well.</p><p> The college search is an involved process, but at its core lies an opportunity to sample different schools and lives and find your most desirable trajectory, a path usually proportional to a college’s ability to fulfill what’s important to you. Therefore, a question critical to the college decision is discerning what really matters to you in an academic setting. It may be vocational or it may be purely epistemological. In either case, and everywhere in between, finding what matters to you is paramount. For some, that may not be college, for other’s it is. If what matters to you is a shot at a great undergraduate school, I’ll briefly show you some tips to organize your application and give you a high level view of what to expect. I hope this guide is helpful; it’s my hope that it makes for more successful and manageable applications and gives you choice in your future. </p> <h2 id=sec1>Where to begin</h2> <p class=text-muted>“Your understanding of your inner life holds the meaning of your life” -Tolstoy</p> <p> In deciding where to apply, you must first start with you and think what’s important to you, requiring reflection and consideration. Do you value being close to home, or do you think leaving would be a greater educational experience? Are you looking for schools with strong subject areas that currently appeal to you, or are you looking to have a school with a wide breadth of avenues, or do you know schools that do both? Or is your main concern finding the sweet spot between affording college and getting a quality education? Considering what’s important to you--and what isn’t--is a good way to cast aside extraneous schools and gain clarity for what you actually want. It can be helpful to write down the things you value and also that the elements that you don’t. A key point here in determining what you want--and a lesson I still struggle with though seeing it enacted repeatedly--is choosing to do or value the things that you feel like you should like over those that you actually do. Take this opportunity to break out of the ‘should,’ and think about what you really want. The application process is all about you, so make sure you seek to get a better understanding of what you want. Once you have down some things that you value, put them on paper to free the weight from your mind. Here are some things that may concern you. Some things you may consider are: </p> <dl> <dt>Academics <dd>The most important rubric, some things to consider when assessing your academic journey at a school are: does this school have the program that interests you. If I don’t know what I’m into, will transferring exploring different subjects or sampling classes be easy. How are the rankings in my program? What’s the level of quality? Is this a liberal arts setting? How easy would it be to get into research? Do you think here that your peers will intellectually stimulate and challenge you? <dt>Housing <dd>Is this a fully on-campus residential setting, meaning that all kids live on campus or do most people get apartments? <dt>Food <dd>Does this college accommodate my dietary, religious, or NY Foodie needs? <dt>Athletics <dd>Does this school have a team that’s interested in me? Are strong school athletic events important to me or just a plus (or minus)? <dt>Alumni Network <dd> How strong is the alumni network? <dt>Prestige <dd>How important is this to you and in your field. <dt>Financial Aid <dd>Can you afford to attend this school with the current aid in place? </dl> <p>After asking yourself these questions, now pose them to your colleges. No matter how fun it would be, living the undergraduate experience at 200 universities is unlikely, so rely on other students’ experiences and university websites. Learn from others’ experiences by searching schools with free, third-party services. A great tool that I used--though some categories do raise some eyebrows--is <a href=collegeprowler.com>CollegeProwler</a>, a website that allows you to get ratings on dorm quality, food, social life, by students submitting their own feedback, allowing an imperfect way to compare how schools stack up.</p> <p><a href=collegeconfidential.com>College Confidential</a> offers a reddit like approach to the college approach, and offers helpful anonymous forums on many college questions. Remember that both these services are imperfect tools, apparent even by glancing at my own school’s perhaps too generous rankings on the website. But, like a standardized test, they offer an imperfect way to compare schools, but they will give you questions to ask when you then consult their official websites or reach out to current students.</p> <p>When you have a list of schools that you like and can afford to attend (we’ll talk about this extensively, no worries), list their names, get organized and put them down in a spreadsheet. If you do, it will be a lot more fun and much less stressful and uncertain. </p> <h2 id=sec2>Getting a Spread of Schools</h2> <p> Importantly the schools that interest you will have varying acceptance rates. Viewing schools as difficulty levels, strive to get a variety of acceptance rates so that if you're more difficult schools don’t work out, you still have options. By diversifying, you won’t have all your eggs in one basket. In general, I would recommend having one or two schools in your list where you know you can gain acceptance. And then a couple of reach schools, places where getting in will be difficult but you still have a chance. Importantly, don’t count yourself out from prestigious schools because you think the difficulty level might be too high. I can’t stress this enough. You’re not accepted to the colleges you don’t apply to, and even if you get a rejection letter--I got my fair share--they’re fun to pull out from time to time after you’re accepted elsewhere.</p> <h2 id=sec3>Getting a Price Tag</h2> <p> Colleges will rarely cost you what they advertise. Some of the most affordable schools--Harvard, Stanford--appear initially obscenely expensive, but though an annual cost of ~$60,000, 90% of students find that Harvard’s financial aid makes college more affordable than their public option. Nailing down how much a university costs will require some leg work, and in order to do that, we need to understand the types of aid offered.</p> <h4>Get a Fee Waiver for All Applications</h4> <p>The Questbridge application is for students of financial hardship. I highly advise checking to see if you qualify as admission fees are waived.</p> <h4>Types of Institutional Aid</h4> <dl><dt>Need <dd>Some schools, especially private colleges and universities, will note that they meet full financial needs through need-based aid, meaning that if you are accepted to that school, the school will assess your need through financial statements usually submitted through the CSS/Financial Aid Profile, and will fully provide the aid that you’re deemed to need. What the school defines as ‘full need,’ however, varies dramatically per school, so be cautious in this. Many of these schools also employ ‘need-bind’ admittance, meaning that the school does not weigh your ability in the application process. <dt>Merit <dd>Many schools, public and private, offer merit aid which is given to students based on their academic qualifications. By analogy, this would be considered in line with a traditional scholarship, that because a student does ‘X’ exceptionally well, the school will give them ‘Y,’ hence, merit. A good example of this is the University of Alabama which offers a full tuition scholarship to students who have scored over a 32 on their ACT. Merit aid may be automatically awarded or through separate applications. Make sure you know which applies at your school.</dl> <h4>Outside Aid</h4> <dl><dt>Federal Aid <dd>Perkins and Stafford Loans are subsidized government student loans that your FAFSA financial aid report will determine whether you’re eligible to receive. <dt>Scholarships <dd>Usually private, outside aid to study a specific subject, make sure to apply for local scholarships either posted at your guidance office or showcased in newspapers as your chances of winning are significantly higher. </dl> <h4>Get a Price Tag</h4> <p>As you won’t usually pay the price that a university costs, understanding the types of institutional financial aid will help us decode a college’s landing page. Many schools offer a net price calculator where students can input their family’s assets and get a rough approximation on what they’ll owe. If a school offers need-based aid, also assess whether the school offers merit aid that you can also apply to receive. Many times merit aid applications have different deadlines then application, so make sure to check. To double check what you’ll approximately be paying, the US Department of Education has set up a college cost calculator that also allows students to see a mean price of cost, debt, and graduation indexed per school. My recommendation is to use both the college’s calculators and the government’s assessment. Personally, my aid was overestimated on many college calculators contrasted with that I received. Finally, also tally up the cost of applying to schools. We’ll cover this later, but add $16 to each application for the CSS/College Financial Profile and $8 if you choose to independently submit an ACT or SAT. Importantly, if application fees are a barrier to you, you may be eligible for the Questbridge application, which I highly recommend doing if you can. While applying can be expensive, it’s a fantastic investment. With a well-put-together application, one can use an application to make hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime, a good investment.</p> <p> After understanding what merit and need based aid you can expect to receive, put your tentative aid down in the spreadsheet next to the colleges that you’ve selected. If a school is obscenely expensive, feel no remorse in cutting it from your application list. You may notice that we’re living and dying by an organized spreadsheet--for good reason; writing out as much as you can will prevent you from stressing out, forgetting things, and putting yourself in the way of your success. </p> <h4>Strategy</h4> <p>When applying to colleges it can be helpful to have an overarching strategy for how you apply. For example, you may search out schools that have strong engineering programs, excellent music or art program, or with great basketball teams. The process that I used to receive a better financial aid package was applying to top-rated, high financial aid schools, and then using their offers barter between them in order to receive a better deal. I started out by applying to a public school and getting a full-tuition scholarship, which I then used to negotiate with private schools. Whatever the case, think whether your application process offers an opportunity to strategize.</p> <h4>Get Away from Bad Aid Information</h4> <p>There’s a lot of poor information out there on college expenses, most notably with the Ivy League, which has some of the best financial aid in the nation. In my case, it’s less expensive to go to Harvard than the University of Minnesota. In addition, many states have in-state tuition reciprocity with those neighboring and even some international reciprocity exists, for example between Minnesota and Manitoba. The point is seek out the facts yourself, use the tools mentioned, and you’ll thank yourself later.</p> <h2 id=sec4>What You Need to Do</h2> <p> Now that you have a list of schools that address what matters to you and represent varying acceptance rates, track down what you need to get to apply for them. Things to look for are whether they accept the common application or whether they have their own application--we’ll go over what this means--when they need test scores submitted, what tests they require, and what questions their supplements ask. Instead of working a summer job my junior year, I spent the time off preparing for application season. While you could, generously, net a couple thousand over the summer, preparing for college can save and net you tens of thousands many times over a lifetime. Here’s a high level of what you’ll probably see </p> <dl><dt>Transcript <dd>Colleges will want to see how you utilized your time in high school, looking for whether you took a challenging course load relative to that offered in your school. Many times colleges will weigh the high school junior and sophomore years with more clout than freshman year as they understand the adjustment period can make for some grade dips. Overall, schools are mindful of trends in your transcript, so don’t be too worried about an individual poor grade or two, and if possible have your guidance counselor speak to why the dip may have occurred. You will submit this when you apply. <dt>Mid Year Report. <dd>This means that if you have applied early action then you will also need to submit a transcript at the halfway point of your senior year. <dt>Final Report <dd>After you’ve been accepted to attend your school, the school will need you to submit a transcript from your entire time in high school. <dt>ACT/SAT/SAT Subjects <dd>See the ACT/SAT/SAT Subjects sections, but these tests provide a way to directly compare an extremely diverse and talented application pool. The best part about them is that you can improve your score and candidacy in an afternoon. <dt>Recommendation letters <dd>These are letters that close teachers, guidance counselors, or coaches write about you and then send to colleges. Choosing recommenders early who really know you is critical to the process. <dt>Common App <dd>The Common App is a universal application that gives the admissions committee an idea of how you spent your time during high school and your personal and family background. The nice thing about it is that most colleges accept it, meaning you won’t have to fill it out basic information every time you apply somewhere. <dt>Common App Essay <dd>The Common App essay is a blanket personal statement intended to act as a way for the committee to get to know you and what matters to you. <dt>Supplement Essay <dd>The supplement essay is a way for the a school to directly hear your thoughts on a question or prompt they pose. <dt>Optional Essay <dd>Some schools have optional essays included in the student application. The same advice for the supplement essay applies to the optional essay. While schools say these are optional, if you’re passionate about the school, do them anyway. <dt>Additional Materials <dd>If you’re applying to a music or art program, you may also have the opportunity to submit additional information. <dt>School Specific Applications <dd>Some schools will have individual applications and will not employ the common app. These schools are usually public universities. In this case, you will likely have to resubmit much of the information that you filled out in the common app. <dt>Merit Scholarship Deadlines <dd>If Merit aid is offered, you’ll find it listed under financial aid. We will go through what merit aid means, but know that it will usually require additional writings. <dt>CSS/Financial Aid Profile <dd>This is the sneakiest part of the process in my opinion. If you’re accepted into a private college that offers need-based financial aid, the college will naturally need to assess how much you need of their aid. The tool that many colleges use to assess aid is the CSS/College Profile, which is a collection of your family’s worth through a secure portal that the school then uses to assess your aid. Beside all your colleges that have need aid, make sure to include CSS / Financial Aid Profile as a requirement in the spreadsheet next to them. The profile will also charge you ~$16 dollars to each school that you apply.</dl> <h4>Take away</h4> <p>That may seem like a lot, and it is, so be sure to organize exactly what schools need what and by when in a spreadsheet. You’re captain of your own ship, so make sure it’s easy to sail. </p> <h2 id=sec5>Types of Decisions</h2> <p> <dl><dt>Early Action <dd>Early action allows you to apply to a school early, a convenience as you’ll hear back early on in your acceptance and before other school’s regular application deadlines allowing you to write more applications for other schools if need be. Some schools will offer exclusive early action, which means that you can apply early to that school but not any other school. My advice is to take advantage of early action as you can use the early feedback of your application. Also, if you’re waitlisted, you then get another round at regular decision where the counselors will weigh your applications again. <dt>Early Decision <dd>Though they sound alike, early action is different from early decision because in early decision you sign a contract saying that you will attend the school if you are accepted. If you’re totally invested in a school and that’s for sure where you want to go, then go for it! If not, then hold off. Statistically, the acceptance rate for early action and decision are higher than for regular decision, but college counselors will say that this is a result of more qualified applicants applying, which is probably true. <dt>Rolling Admission <dd>Rolling admission is basically the thought that the school will take qualified applicants until the class is filled. Therefore, as always, it behooves you to apply early. <dt>Regular Decision <dd>This is the final and regular opportunity to apply for a school. Make sure you get your applications in before this deadline so you don’t have to worry about them. Most of your applications will be regular.</dl> <h4>Record your Dates</h4> </p><p>Mark down next to your schools when you intend to apply for them, what you need to submit them, and make sure that you plan so that you can. </p> <h2 id=sec6>Tests and Their Advantage</h2> <p> No matter what college you apply to, you’ll likely have to submit at least one standardized test. In an application base from around the world, standardized tests offer an imperfect way to access a candidate’s ability on a level playing field.This offers a huge advantage, as unlike your GPA, extra-curriculars, etc, you can dramatically improve this portion of your application in a matter of a hours. We’ll walk through all the tests you’ll see if you’re a domestic student, but always keep in mind that these tests don’t assess how ‘smart’ you are, just how good you are at taking that prescribed test, and--as with anything--you’ll get better the more you study.</p> <dl><dt>ACT and SAT <dd>Traditionally taken by middle America, the ACT is an equivalent of the SAT. Most schools will require one or the other but also sometimes both, though neither is prefered over the other. These tests do have different structures, however. The SAT allows more time for answering questions, but I found the questions trickier whereas the ACT is a speed test and is highly predictable. I recommend taking both. If the price for either test is a barrier, there are waivers for their price accessible via both companies’ websites and many schools offer a free testing. Testings are held around the year and vary annually, so head to either’s website to check when the tests are being offered and to sign up. Get to the test registration early, as registration closes a good time ahead of the actual test. You’ll be required to submit a photo using the online tool and to bring a photo ID on test day. <dt>SAT Subjects <dd>Two or three SAT Subjects are usually required when applying to the most difficult schools. These exams test, as their name suggest, a specific subject and are best taken after your AP’s (if you have them) as you’ll be able to draw on that knowledge. Again, study options abound, and I recommend you check them out as these tests, like all standardized tests, have a high degree of predictability. How you can effectively study for the tests Due to your ability to change your test standing in a sitting, I highly recommend studying for whichever test you take; yes you can study, and yes it is effective. Go to a bookstore, check out the test prep section, and find a book that you like. I personally and adamantly suggest the <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=cracking+the+act"><it>Princeton Review Cracking the ACT</it></a>. My story with this is that I pulled a high score my first go, but it wasn’t one that I was personally very proud of. I was bummed. I went to school and started lifting some weights when I ran into my friend stretching out on the pull up bar. He asked me why I was down, and I told him my test blues. To which he responded, ‘well, you know you can study for that?’ and I literally saw the heavens part. I had no idea I could study for it! He recommended to me the Princeton Review, Cracking the ACT, and after school I went online to purchase a copy when my mom alerted me that I’d be late for play (where I played a drunkard and had a great time). When I was waiting to come on stage, I told my older friend who would also attend Harvard, that I would be purchasing the book. He responded with, ‘Yeah! That’s the book I used! Want to borrow it?’ I met him at his house after rehearsal, picked up his book from him, and would study early Saturday mornings in the winter before having to help my parents shovel. After doing that consistently for a month or so, my score bumped 5 points, and I was walking on air. The moral of the story is study. Make a schedule and stick to it. You’ll thank yourself later. <dt>Study or Prep Class? <dd>If you’re between taking a prep class or buying a book--and this is my personal opinion--I’d go book every time as I believe it increases the amount of time you’re solving problems. It’s a lot like weightlifting. Sure, you can buy a fitness coach, but the only thing that’s going to have you put on muscle is how many reps you do. That said, do the one which will help you the most. If you think it will, it probably will. <dt>Submitting your Scores <dd>For the ACT and SAT, you can take both tests more than once and can usually just report your highest total score to the school (as you’re scored in different areas on the test such as math, science, english, etc). That said, some schools, like Pomona, will require you to report all your test scores. Therefore, if you report that you’ve taken the ACT nine times and did poorly on eight of them, the admission committee will also see this record. Research what tests your school wants you to submit. Both the ACT and SAT provide score submit, where test takers can write in colleges they’d like the ACT to provide their test scores to for free. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all about the free. That said, the danger with this is that if you bomb a standardized test, that score is headed straight to the college you want to get in, whereas if you don’t select the college then it won’t, but you’ll have to pay for submitting your score later via on the online tool where you also registered. In summary, see what tests your schools ask for, write them down in the spreadsheet you’ve been adding to, and then start studying for the tests that you need to take. Your goal here is to get these tests out of the way with good scores ASAP so that you can sink time into the more nuanced portions of the app instead of having to be worried about retaking your standardized tests.</dl> <h4>MileStone Check</h4> <p>At this point you should have a list of colleges of varying admission rates that you would like to attend in a spreadsheet. In addition, you should know approximately how much each will cost you and when you need to get them what. While doing this, you should also be studying for the standardized tests you’ll need to take. See this as your roadmap. You can go really really quickly at a lot of different things, but without the roadmap, it’s easy to get lost.</p> <h2 id=sec7>Recommendations</h2> <p> Most colleges require two or three recommendations. Make sure you’re getting your recommenders the information they need and am setting them up for success. In the preceding version of the common app, the company allowed the submission of a resume or an activities sheet--a sheet that detailed all the thing that you did in school--and some schools still do. While the Common App now has no place to upload an activities sheet on it, building one out allows you to detail the honors, awards, and other information on your accomplishments that gives you something ready-made that you can submit to both your recommenders and scholarships to showcase your accomplishments.</p> <p>Once you have your activities sheet detailed, you can now contact counselors with the detailed information that you’ve created. Most schools require two recommendation letters from faculty along with a letter from your representative counselor. When picking your recommenders, choose the people that know you best and can detail what makes you you. By submitting your activity sheet to your counselors, you’ll not only give them a point of reference for them to begin, but you’ll get your application letter back sooner as you will make their job easier for them. This is your job. As a student, your job is to make your recommenders’ job easier for them. If you don’t send them an activities sheet, send them something else. Email the people you’re interested in writing as soon as possible to avoid an app rush from other students. The last thing you want to do is have your recommender cranking out your letter in an afternoon as this will most likely not be your best foot forward. After giving your recommenders, it’s alright to check in and see how the letters are coming and whether they’d like any information. Again, your job is to make your counselor's’ job easy which is why it’s important to create your activities sheet before you begin. </p> <h2 id=sec8>Common Application</h2> <p> Fill out the common app as instructed the common app website. The application is meant to remove a lot of the redundancy of the process by centralizing the information of students so you don’t have re-enter it every time. The most difficult part of the common app is the essay at the end, which is your opportunity to introduce yourself to every college that takes the common app. Before diving straight away into it or facing writer’s block, warm up a supplement essay or two first.</p> <h2 id=sec9>Supplement Essays</h2> <p> Many schools that you apply to will require supplemental essays. View these as love letters to your schools. While questions may differ, the main objective of this essay is always to explain why you’re a good fit for this school in a way that’s authentic to you. In that, put your best foot forward, but don’t sacrifice your voice in the process. If a school rejects you for who you are--and this is true for all parts of the application--you probably don’t want to go to that school. With the note on voice aside, make sure that this is a good love letter to your school, highlighting the opportunities that are only possible if that school accepts you. This is no place for platitudes. Study the individual school's’ websites, become an expert on their school, and then show them that you’re an expert in their school, and that’s why you understand you want to go. After writing a couple supplement essays, circle back to the common app essay, the essay that’ll be sent to all schools. Having a couple supplements under your belt, writing your common application won’t be as stressful. You’ll know what you’re doing, and you’ll have a closer semblance to your sweetspot. An example of a supplement essay follows at the end.</p> <h2 id=sec10>Common App Essay and Submitting</h2> <p> Now that you have your schools picked, have an idea of how much they’ll cost you, have your testing lined up, made your activities sheet, notified your counselor--meaning your letters of rec are in the fire--and have a good start on your supplement essays, it’s time to face down the common app essay. This essay is a universal essay, so make sure not to put any school specific references in it. Once you submit your common app once, it becomes non editable, so ensure that it’s school agnostic. Returning to the common app essay, this is a place to be you. Again, getting into a school is as much about you as the school. If they deny you for who you are, then you probably don’t want to go anyway. There are an infinite ways to write the common app essay, but in whatever way you choose make it’s you, that it’s grammatically impeccable, and something that you can be proud of. Write the essay that you would be proud writing, that lets the committee into your life. An excellent reference guide that does just that is <a href=http://admissions.yale.edu/advice-putting-together-your-application>Yale’s information.</a> I highly recommend checking it out for further advice. My common App essay is at the end.</p> <h4>Good Housekeeping on Essays</h4> <p>Once you’ve written everything, well, you’ve written everything. This doesn’t mean you’re done. Proofread it and proofread it again. The best thing you can do in this is start early so that you can also sleep on your works and consider them. Once you find what you’ve written submission ready, work with another teacher or parent to go through your essays to seek out the grammatical mistakes that you might have made. Don’t have a committee write your essay, but do get a couple of trusted voices in the process to ensure that the essays represent you well and in a way that puts the foot that you want forward.</p> <h4>Submitting your common application</h4> <p>Once you submit your application, your common app will be completely locked, meaning you won’t be able to edit anything you’ve submitted, and it will stay the same preventing any further adjustments including any to your essays, extracurricular activities. You will still be able to edit other school’s supplement section. Make sure that you have as mentioned double checked everything. Once you submit, then--zip--your application will be whisked over in a couple of seconds, and you’ll lean back in your chair and feel a mixture of ‘is that it?’ and accomplishment.</p> <h2 id=sec11>Other Submissions</h2> <p>Once you submit your Common Application, make sure to also get the below in before your deadlines.</p> <dl><dt>Transcripts <dd>Colleges that you apply to will initially want to see your high school performance up to senior winter, and if you’re accepted and then accept, spring. Stop by your counselor’s office and give them the list of the colleges that you’ve applied to, probably via spreadsheet, so that they know to whom to send your transcript. Colleges will weigh your academic performance relative to your school, so if you’ve taken the most difficult curriculum at your school, then most committees will weigh that against the opportunities available at your school and not other schools. If you have taken college classes during your time at school, you will also need to submit your college transcripts to your tentative colleges. While colleges will usually charge a fee to mail these, colleges will want to see how you’ve done in a similar environment. If the university you’re applying to accepts transfer credits then even just one transfered course may save you hundreds or thousands of dollars. <dt>Test Scores <dd>After you have submitted your online application, make sure that the schools that you’ve applied to also have your necessary test scores. If you haven’t sent these through score report when you were in your test sitting, then head to either the SAT or ACT website, login through the account that you’ve created and select the schools that need your test scores for either test to then send them. <dt>Recommendation Letters <dd>Having given your recommenders plenty of time and your activities sheet to guide them, now make sure that your recommender submits the information to your respective school before the application date ends either through mailing them or third party submission software that your school may use. <dt>“Optional” Interview <dd>After you’ve applied, many schools will coordinate an ‘optional’ interview for you with an alum of the school. Make sure that you go to this. The interview, I think, is one of the key ways that you can convey what the on-paper application process can’t. After you do an interview, the interviewer will write a letter to the school following up on your candidacy that will end up in your admissions folder and give the admissions council his/her/their opinion. <dt>Letter Updates <dd>If you’re applying to a school early action, then your application will freeze when you submit the common app with everything you’ve done up to November senior year. That leaves a gap of two months between early and regular admission in which a lot can happen. If something worthwhile occurs during this time, I highly suggest writing a letter to the colleges that you’re applying to updating them and letting them know that you’re still seriously considering attending the school if accepted. I recommend doing this after application and of course before decision day. <dt>Financial Aid Information <dd>In order to find out how much aid the school will actually give you, sit down with your parents or guardians and fill out the CSS/College Financial Aid Profile which is basically an information collection of your family’s financial worth in order to gauge need. Importantly, college judge need and weigh the ability to pay different. The CSS/College Financial Aid Profile is a way for private schools to run your data through their need estimator algorithms. Second, also apply for the FAFSA, which may open eligibility for Perkin and Stafford loans. In both instances, filling these out may be confusing, so work with a parent or guardian to do so. <dt>End of Year Transcript Submit <dd>At the end of the year, after you’ve decided where you’ll go after decision date, you’ll also need to mail in an end of year transcript to your school.</dl> <h2 id=sec12>Post Submission</h2> <p> Once you have submitted your application, you’ll eventually hear a response from the colleges. Acceptance or rejection are straightforward outcome, but what do you do about the waitlist? If you get on the waitlist, just assume that you won’t get in but do select to be further considered. Students do get in off the waitlist, but by assuming that you won’t, it’ll be a pleasant surprise over an unexpected disappointment. If you are placed on a waitlist, I recommend sending a letter to the school saying that you’re still invested in it and seriously considering attending if the school overturns your decision.</p> <p> If you’re accepted to multiple schools, and the school you want to attend didn’t give you the aid you were looking for, don’t be shy to let your school know that and that you’ve been accepted at other universities that--if true--have given you better aid. A simple letter like this could be worth thousands of extra dollars in aid.</p> <h4>How to decide</h4> <p>‘The only thing worse than not having a choice is having too many.’ Choosing the college you’ll attend can be difficult when given multiple acceptances. Refer back to that original list of values you made to apply in the first place and make sure you’ll have an idea of what your options will cost you. Having that information on hand, think about where you would regret not going to most and that may give you insight on where you’d like to go most.</p> <h4>After Decision</h4> <p>After you’ve accepted where you’re attending, many schools will have you make a deposit to confirm your place in the class. Just hit this date, and you’ll be fine. Upon acceptance to some universities, they may also ask you to do placement tests for your own guidance of what classes to take. Do them, and you’ll be fine. </p> <h2 id=sec13>Opening Days</h2> <h4>Do a first year program</h4> <p>In addition, you may have the opportunity to attend a pre-orientation program. Many students my age write that their pre-orientation program was one of the best things they’ve ever done. It will set you up with a great group of friends right of the gate.</p> <h4>Connect don’t Compare</h4> <p>Once you’re in college you’ll find people dramatically different from you and better than you in most things. Instead of feeling intimidated by this, having other students more skilled in some areas than you--you’ll be more skilled in others--see it as a tremendous opportunity to learn from others. While connecting instead of comparing with your peers may seem like obvious advice now, make sure to keep that the case when you enter college. Your peers will probably be the best experience of your college process, so make sure that you embrace them.</p> <h4>Explore</h4> <p>When you get to school, try a bunch of stuff out and don’t be afraid to quit the things that you don't feel capture your interest. As a freshman, you’re going to be hit by all sorts of information about joining clubs or getting involved in activities. My advice here is to try all that may interest you--explore--but be sure to cut them as soon as you feel like you’re not getting a lot out of it. By doing this you’ll meet a variety of people from all different types of backgrounds which will remain people you know or possibly your friends even if you choose not to stick with the activity. This is your time to sample what’s possible, and don’t worry about sticking with them if they’re not of interest to you.</p> <h4>Make friends not connections</h4> <p>Finally, many people will tell you that you need to make connections in college. Don’t. Make friends. ‘Connections” won’t help you out if your car breaks down, friends will. Be a good person, and you’ll thank yourself for it later</p> <h4>Highest Highs, Lowest Lows</h4> <p> In college, just expect that you're going to face periods where you're the happiest you've ever been and the saddest. Expect this will be the case and accept that it can take up to a year to get used to a new place.</p> <h4>Join the Summer Playbook</h4> <p>No, seriously. The Playbook connects thousands of students around the world. Through it, some sudents were able to build community at their college before even setting foot on campus. The Playbook's mission is to make travel more accessible, social, and meaningful for college students.</p> <hr> <h2 id=sec14>Appendix: Supplement Essay 1</h2> <p class=text-muted>Plagerism in any way is forbidden</p> <h3><i>Yale Supplement Essay: Of Jumpsuits and Hot Tubs</i></h3> <p>When I saw it, I knew. One April day I glimpsed the future—well, actually the past. There, folded upon a garage sale table, beckoned a fluorescent orange and pink nylon jumpsuit: size, women’s medium. Although immobile, I heard its swishes. Two dollars later, I welcomed in my new track warm-ups. Yale, in this time together, I am loosening up the tie. I have a confession. If you invite me to your New Haven pagoda, you are inviting an all-around character. The stories are true. I like some peculiar things. I snowshoe at night, go to operas, build winter shelters, and pet stingrays before prom night. That said, however, I am dead serious about education. While hopefully conveyed through the rest of my application, I genuinely love learning. My favorite book at age five was a DK rocks and mineral identification guide; at age nine I planned on revolutionizing the world’s energy market with hydrogen— I later conducted basement electrolysis much to the concern of my Hindenburg-leery mom; and in fifth grade, I pondered harnessing the power of black holes.</p> <p>I love ideas and information, but I also relish having fun through them. In short, I like to laugh, especially at myself. This can be accomplished through taping “Krebs-” over the “Bi” in a “Bicycles only” sign or by wearing a sombrero, water-wings, and aviators while hot tubbing with Minnesota’s brightest at State Knowledge Bowl. Regardless, I make sure to loosen up with some flair, a theme apparent in the now named “Gym-Class Experiment.”</p> <p>Raising hands and walking in line are second-nature to students. They conform. Frighteningly, many conform without thinking. Curious of how deep this acceptance went, one day I enacted a tongue-in-cheek inquiry. Excusing myself early to gym class, I greeted everyone entering the locker room with a whispered “Hey dude.” The class slowly trickled in past my locker and greetings. Soon, a usually boisterous group of boys were not only speaking in whispers but also enforcing the quasi-rule upon each other. I was humored and amazed. Upon lacing up my shoes, I turned around and asked, “Why are you whispering?” I walked out, leaving my peers thinking and watching for lemming syndrome the rest of the day.</p> <p>Something happened when I wore my 1980’s-esque jumpsuit to track. At first, I received a smattering of odd looks, high-fives, and ogling—embarrassingly enough, I soon discovered they were partially see-through—but the next meet I attended, I started seeing similar jumpsuits. In fact, every consecutive meet after my suit’s debut, more jumpsuits kept popping up. Eventually, even my entire cross-country team set aside a day to raid local Goodwills and Savers looking for duplicates. If you accept me to Yale, you are getting more than just a hard-working man who loves learning and life’s humor. You are getting a true character, an individual, a man who starts Northern Minnesotan track-meet fads with a fluorescent orange and pink nylon jumpsuit: size, women’s medium.</p> <h2 id=sec15>Appendix: Supplement Essay 2</h2> <p class=text-muted>Plagerism in any way is forbidden</p> <h3><i>Amherst Supplement Essay: Hands</i></h3> <p>Who are those scoundrels? It’s a crisp autumn day, and you’re in the woods. You’re going for a walk, enjoying the smells, breeze, and rustling trees— the tapestry of fall. Maybe you’re walking your dog, or who knows, maybe you’re one of those iconoclastic cat-walkers. Regardless, you see it: the soda bottles, sandwich wrappers, and plastic bags. Besides the obvious question of who eats a Big Mac in the middle of the woods, who just drops their trash? This selfish act infuriates me.</p> <p>JFK didn’t give his Frost Library speech about littering, but we’re describing the same ethos. Squandering your education is selfish. It means taking the convenient route and disregarding what you leave behind. If JFK and I were walking our dogs (or cats) together, I know we would take the time to bend over and clean up the trash we encounter. It concerns me that some people won’t.</p> <p>It’s perplexing how “wood trash” is perpetually wet. When I emerge from the woods with milk jugs, candy wrappers, and the occasional T-shirt—all dripping water—people always ask, “Why did you pick that up?” My favorite response is, “I have hands.” If you don’t pick it up, who will? Amherst’s education is top-notch, but if you attend and only use that knowledge to enrich yourself . . . now that’s a waste. I want to attend Amherst not only for my B.A., but so I can clean up more than my neighborhood’s messes. Someday, when I’m working around the clock on some far-out, low- success probability, but phenomenally important drug or product, and my colleague takes me aside and asks, “Luke, why are you doing this?” I’ll smile to myself. This time, instead of saying “I have hands,” I want to answer, “Because I went to Amherst.”</p> <h2 id=sec16>Appendix: Common Application Essay</h2> <h3><i>Where's Waldo?: U of Chicago Supplement</i></h3> <p>Essay 6</p> <p>Dec 23, 2009</p> <p><i>These testimonies were acquired from a C.I.A. black base operating in the lower Polochic Valley, Guatamala.</i></p> <p><i>Translations provided by Luke Heine.</i></p> <p><b>Jose Joquin (Gang Member, 1990-1998):</b> He was terrible. His eyes were cold moons, hard, lacking soul. When I left, he knew; his eyes knew. They weren’t eyes of man but of demon! I remember the things he did… he was a demon (sobbing). You must understand. I grew up in Bogota poor, real poor—ya’ know. It was a way out. This day in January, I needed to do it. I knew he was in town. I saw the hats. The men always wear them. He says they offer safety, but they’re really just maize sacks. I was young, a different man then. The fields burned in the South. I had to do it. There was no future! They were going to Mexico. Had I known what I do now, I would have never… but I didn’t, O.K.! Look, I don’t know what he’s doing now. But—I’m not sure if you’d want to either.</p> <p><b>Pueblo Muri (Street Vendor, 2001)</b> Fools! The man you seek is invisible. He goes by many names, seeing much. His skin is pale and as long as his clothes are banded with the sap of the Bignonia Chica, you’ll find rocks talking (local expression) before you find him. The bands protect him. You will never understand (spits).</p> <p><b>Alex Quinn (Financier, 1989-1991):</b> Excuse me, but I invest for numerous clients. I should not be punished for doing a successful job. Shorting stocks is not a felony, although, perhaps that escapes your reason. Not shorting Marubeni (a Korean company investing heavily in Columbian fields) would be financial folly. Plus, it was my client’s request. Yes, I’ve heard the controversy, but I didn’t know of his involvement with burning. Sir, I assure you, I had no personal connection with the man—trust me. I found him quite repulsive in reality. I invited him to a shareholder meeting—a gesture I do for all clients. Don’t overthink that. Anyways, black-tie event mind you, the man showed up wearing jeans. A positive bore at dinner, he said nothing: quite flat, didn’t even take off his hat. He simply wore this self-assured smile—like he knew something. He always had that look, like he knew something. . . Anyways, that’s where I last saw him. The man even made me pick up the check—probably smiled about that as well.</p> <p><i>Testimonies 33-35</i></p> <p>***</p> <p><i>Pancho Walnado, [codename WALDO], is suspected of running Juarez’s notorious narcotics gang “Chicos Rayas” or Striped Boys.

I tucked in behind. Six Pentair and Target jerseys fluttered in my shadow. Their time to “pull,” to face the faceless prairie winds, would come. Mine just passed. The switch-grass quilt rippled under the sky, and my thoughts soon spun faster under my helmet than my wheels.</p> <p>And so, there I was again—looking down a gravelly driveway, my cheering mom and dad holding Band-Aids and disassembled training-wheels. I remembered years later peering into a dusty garage and seeing a rusty, cobwebbed road bike in the corner. It was beautiful. I remembered repair manuals, greasy fingers, and my first sun-drenched ride. My hands clenched. I remembered counting Christmas money, studying the newly broken frame, and rolling my bike into a dark garage.</p> <p>A Pentair rider swept by and relieved the Turkish rider who now drank from his water bottle. I checked my odometer and the riders behind yet to pull. With sweat cascading down my face and my legs feeling bitter, I cuddled back within my mind, going back five years to my doctor’s office.</p> <p>I heard two knocks. Dr. Rogers few strands of hair waved hello as he bustled into the room. After my first physical’s inevitable awkwardness, Dr. Rogers signed my sport forms, asked about school, and then mentioned he saw me biking. He smiled when my hands jumped to describe my self-repaired 1973 Schwinn Traveler but frowned as I revealed its current condition. Dr. Rogers nodded slowly, found his feet, and said, “It’ll work out.” Later that night, I got a call. My doctor disassembled his winter bike-trainer and now had a bike to spare—if, adding a clinical touch, I wore a helmet.</p> <p>The next day, I walked into my doctor’s white, organized garage and saw a crush-blue 1987 Cannondale. It was beautiful. After explaining clip-in pedals and giving me bike shorts and shoes, Dr. Rogers added, “While it’s not the fastest bike, it’ll get you out the door.” I looked up, shook my head, and grinned. That night, the bike leaned against my bed.</p> <p>My doctor gave me an opportunity. I seized it. My mornings filled with dusty sunglasses, hot pavement, and cool wind. I guzzled gallons of water, devoured books like Super Foods Rx and The Cycling Training’s Bible, and stationary-biked in the winter. Throughout it all, if I ever had a question or needed advice, my doctor was there—a hand on my shoulder. Four years later, I was here: cycling 150 miles across Minnesota with sponsors on my back and a bike under my feet.</p> <p>The line leader gestured. I looked over my shoulder. No one. Just a black ribbon of pavement and one man’s trust. Had it really been that long? Grabbing a last swig of water, I tightened my helmet and paused. I touched it again. Changing gears, I surged to the front of the pace-line and faced the winds anew.</p> <hr> <h4><a href=https://luke87.typeform.com/to/xbTm7N>Provide Feedback</a></h4> <hr> </div><!--/right--> </div><!--/row--> </div><!--/container--> <script src=scripts/vendor.baff0332.js></script> <script src=scripts/plugins.19a1d77b.js></script> <script src=scripts/main.b6c3df09.js></script> <!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --> <script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
