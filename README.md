A free and collaborative repo on advice for students applying to college.

This guide is maintained by the Harvard College Midwest Club and is meant to serve as a comprehensive college information guide for
high school students. It has been so far sent out to over 6,000 principals representing 8,000,000 students.

We would like any additional college advice you feel we've missed, editable in index.html
